<p>Demong king was laughing with delight.</p>
<p>[Kukuku... How good of you to come, Hero. I've been looking forward to our battle!]</p>
<p>For someone named Demon King she had appearance of a rather adorable young girl,
however despite that, she was definitely a ruler of vicious demons.
She hold considerable power.</p>
<p>[Still, unfortunately it appears that's going to be our last battle...
Thinking about that, I cannot help but feel regret.]</p>
<p>The fact that such girl recognized my worth made me a bit happy.</p>
<p>[I hear you. I too was enjoying my fight with you...
It is vexing to think this is going to be our last.]</p>
<p>At main hall of the Demon King's castle.
Me, the hero, responded with assent to words of the Demon King.</p>
<p>In truth, I had no quarrel with Demon King.
She was my enemy with whom I crossed swords multiple times.
Through fighting her I came to understanding that she wasn't really a evil guy.</p>
<p>Rather she was a magnificent ruler.
Comparing to our human pig-king, she was quite a esteemed figure.</p>
<p>That's why I feel regret now that this time has come.</p>
<p>[It is last battle between Hero and Demon King... isn't?
There is hatred between me and you. Yet is this what they call fate?]</p>
<p>Subjugation of the Demon King.
We, hero party, charged with this mission, assaulted Demon King's castle and challenged her to a decisive battle.
And Demon King responded to that and engaged us with all of her strength.</p>
<p>Composed of Hero, Magician, Priest, Martial Artist and Warrior our party finally arrived to the conclusion of our mortal struggle</p>
<p>And at the current moment duel between me, Hero, and Demon King was finally about to start.</p>
<p>Our long journey was also, finally, about to end.</p>
<p>And even Demon King with whom we share destiny...
Regardless of who shall be winner, without doubt only parting awaits us.</p>
<p>We both understood that.
Feeling reluctant about that, it was only natural that we felt a little emotional before our final battle.</p>
<p>[To me you were a truly worthy rival...
As a matter of fact, did you know that I fond of you more than even my subordinates?
To a degree that I've been always looking forward to see you.]</p>
<p>[...Oh ]</p>
<p>However, Demong King was feeling rather strange.
Her usual fearless smile was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>[As I thought, ending my relationship with you here is too regrettable...]</p>
<p>Now she was staring at me with a serious look.</p>
<p>[Say, Hero... There is one proposal I'd like to make.]</p>
<p>With firm resolution she said</p>
<p>[I desire Hero. The thought of parting our ways breaks my heart.]</p>
<p>Hearing that, I opened my eyes wide without thinking.
Because what would follow is words that Demong King should not be saying.</p>
<p>[I shall give half of the world to the Hero.
That's why, join me!]</p>
<p>And then, to me, the Hero, for whom such request ought to be impossible, she said next.</p>
<p>[Let us walk together from now on.
Not as enemy, but ally... Nah, our relationship should become even more, I want to spend every day in joy with you Hero.
Please, will you stand by my side?]</p>
<p>Hearing her, I clenched my fists.</p>
<p>[!」</p>
<p>I recalled my journey so far.</p>
<p>There was great deal of hardships.
And countless absurdities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were companions with whom we shared smile.
And many many people who had expectations of me.
To betray these people - something I couldn't do</p>
<p>There was time when I thought so.</p>
<p>[Are you serious? And giving me half of it!? Yes, I'm gladly joining hands with you!]</p>
<p>I've lost to Demon King's temptation.</p>
<p>After all, it is giving me half of the world we're talking about.
To me there was no reason not to accept it.</p>
<p>[R-really!? Hero, are you really going to join me?]</p>
<p>She was completely surprised as she didn't expect me to heed the Demon King's request.</p>
<p>[I-i am not sure if I'm the one to talk about it...
But is it really fine, you know Hero's pride and duty?]</p>
<p>She started talking about some nonsense.
Demon King not supposed to worry about such things.</p>
<p>[Pride? What's that, is it something tasty? I don't care about duty whatsoever.
In first place it wasn't my choice to become the Hero.
I've been made Hero against my will.]</p>
<p>That's right. I never wanted to become Hero.
As there was no one but me who could be the Hero, so I had no choice but to become one.
It wasn't like I was doing it because I wanted.</p>
<p>[Moreover, even if I defeat you, what do you think I'll get out of it?
Just honor of 'saving human world', isn't it?
So obviously I'd be happy to get half of the world instead.]</p>
<p>[W-well... Still, there ought to be some reward.
Defeating me, the Demon King, wouldn't it yield you some position and authority to at least spend your life without troubles?]</p>
<p>[Eh? I'm not getting anything of sorts... That rotten royal family obviously gonna give some miserly reward.
That's why I'm joining hands with you.
No, I want to join]</p>
<p>[T-then... Well, what about companions? Wouldn't they be sad?]</p>
<p>[There is no way they gonna be sad!!]</p>
<p>This was the moment when I raised my voice to highest today.</p>
<p>Because of these words I've been reminded of certain fact.</p>
<p>[Did you know? I'm in fact... Was childhood friends with the Priest.
I wanted to marry her, so I worked hard during our journey.
But you know, the Priest was actually going out with the Magician.</p>
<p>[Ah...]</p>
<p>[You probably guessed, right?
That's right I'm getting in their way!
Moreover, Martial Artist and Warrior were dating in secret from me, you know!?
I'm serious, there is no place in this party.]</p>
<p>Once I started talking, I couldn't stop.</p>
<p>Before I knew, I was, as if erupting, yelling out all resentment that I've accumulated.</p>
<p>[Even this final battle, indeed it might feel like my companions sacrificed themself so that I could move forward,
but in fact it is different, you know!?
These guys just left me alone in Demon King's castle and went on somewhere, so I had no choice but to move on my own!]</p>
<p>That's right. These companions would be better off dead.
Leaving me behind and becoming normie, these guys are no companions.</p>
<p>[Moreover, the Princess, for whom I worked so hard and who was saying how she expects things of me, turned out to be just some bitch, you know!?
Fuck, leading me on with these suggestive words... How much do you think I hoped for!?
Me fighting for Princess's smile before?
Thinking about it now I wish just to kill my past self.]</p>
<p>My grudge against Princess who used me as she pleased, was so big that I wish never see her face again.</p>
<p>As Hero, I put my life on the line and worked hard...
Hoping one day, well, wouldn't we start going out?
I was thinking such bullshit.</p>
<p>Things like who should I marry in future: Priest or Princess.
Or like why not marry both of them, my past thinking about these stupid things should be just my dark history.</p>
<p>[Even masses who I protected would make fun of me because my face somehow is not right.
Saying stuff like even though I'm hero, I'm average (laughingly), mind your business, idiots!!
On other hand, my companions were all on beautiful side.
And even though I worked harder than anyone else there were times when people praised my companions only...
By that point I already had no idea what I'm fighting for.]</p>
<p>Then I realized.
I had nothing.
I realized that: things that I wanted to protect, happiness that I should have obtained, all was nothing more than illusion.
I understood that even if I work hard, I'm not going to be rewarded in this life.</p>
<p>[For me, the Demong King was the only solace I had.
Whenever we meet, you remained the same.
You acknowledged me, fought me with all of your strength, it was true joy.
And such person I wish to join.]</p>
<p>That's why I was sincerely happy about Demong King needing me.</p>
<p>Her, who recognized me, words strongly moved me.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but to cling to her hand that reached out to me.</p>
<p>[I too wish to fight together with Demon King...]</p>
<p>At my words, Demong King cried</p>
<p>[Sniff-Sniff... Hero, you had a hard life...]</p>
<p>It would seem I had her sympathy.</p>
<p>Her kindness touched me.
That's right, Demong King... I had hard life.</p>
<p>[R-really? Is it ok? Will you join forces with me?
Then I'm happy... Then I too shall swear to bring happiness to the hero!
You shall be happy by my side!
From now on, this mission will become Hero's duty.
Make sure to follow it through, got it?]</p>
<p>[Being able to be by Demon King's side, is more than enough for me to be happy I think.]</p>
<p>[Then come to my side! Until now you've been working hard enough, you shall become happy from now on]</p>
<p>Demon King gently embraced me.
This warmth made want to cry.</p>
<p>[Thank you, Demon King...]</p>
<p>I too once more embraced her firmly.</p>
<p>Even though she is ruler of villainous demons, her body smelled good.
And her body was so soft.
Hugging her made felt extremely good.</p>
<p>Even if she was Demon King, as woman she was quite attractive girl.
Well, with looks of little girl though.</p>
<p>I decided to pledge allegiance to such girl.</p>
<p>I am Hero, however I received half of the world from Demon King and turned traitor.</p>
<p>I'll achieve happiness by her side!</p>
