<p>After I joined forces with Demon King, Human Realm met its end in a blink of eye.</p>
<p>First, my former companions who infiltrated the Demon King castle: Magician, Priest, Martial Artists and Warrior had been captured.
Next, me and Demon King marched into Human Realm, rampaging through it as we pleased.</p>
<p>Human Realm became like my playground.
I provided various support on our road towards the Royal Castle.
Losing their advantage humans were taken by surprise, before long they had no choice but to give up resistance.</p>
<p>From the start, their main force was my Hero Party...
Or should I say as they were dependent on my alone, we overwhelmed them in no time.</p>
<p>And just like that me and Demon King driven Human Realm into corner.</p>
<p>Royal family, their leaders and other important people were captured in the Royal Castle,
trying to negotiate currently.</p>
<p>Also, former Hero Party member were also at that place.
Every one of these guys were also important people to this country so we brought them from Demon King Castle.</p>
<p>[Well, then... Carriers of <ruby>Malkuth<rt>マルクト</rt></ruby> bloodline, who rule over humans.
You have two choices.
First, will you submit to my demands and live?
Or would you rather resist and die.]</p>
<p>There, in front of overbearing Demon King's gaze, was human race princess, tied by ropes.</p>
<p>Her name is Merek Malkuth.
She was lying on the ground.</p>
<p>A big breasted princess with fluffy and wavy blond hair.
She had a gentle, or rather neat appearance, but...
She was a bitch who spent night after night doing erotic things handsome guy that caught her attention.
Working me to the ground for miser reward, while drowning herself in pleasure.
She was unforigable.</p>
<p>[How can you be so cruel...
What are you demanding of such helpless and innocent me?]</p>
<p>She said with trembling voice.
It might look like she is afraid, but it was just her acting.
This girl wasn't so innocent as to be scared.</p>
<p>[Give your world.
Hand me over yours human world.]</p>
<p>[S-suddenly killing my father and all of the sudden demanding of me such important decision...]</p>
<p>By the way, the King, who was Merek's father, has been killed by the Demon King.
With him being fat as pig and having such nasty personality, it would seem he was promptly killed.</p>
<p>[O, The Great King of demons... I beg you, grant your mercy to us, pathetic humans]</p>
<p>The Princess pleading in tears.
Looking at her appearance, my cheeks twitched.</p>
<p>[Whoah... Demon King, she only thinks about her own self-preservation, so no point in talking with her, don't you think?]</p>
<p>The way she spoke, attempting to butter you up, was quite familiar to me.
I remembered how she tricked me speaking in a similar manner.</p>
<p>[But of course. I've gave but only two choices to her.
She should know that any other answer will lead her to death.]</p>
<p>Demon King agreed at my words of advice.
It would seem she had no intention of listening to her.
I had no need to worry, I guess?</p>
<p>[Well, if you're not going to heed my demands, then I'm just going to destroy humanity.
Which means you hold in your hands fate of the human race.
Whether you die, survive or do as you please... Well then, what are you going to do?]</p>
<p>[...I cannot allow humanity to be erased from Sefirot!]</p>
<p>As one would expect, even corrupt princess couldn't accept extinction of human race.
By the way, 'Sefirot' was a name given to the tree that that world was composed of.
Also known as 'Tree of Life'.
With its 10 branches it hosted 10 worlds.</p>
<p><strong>TL Note:</strong> Tree of Life refers to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefirot with name of worlds taken from name of nodes there.</p>
<p>Various races ruled over these various worlds.</p>
<p>10th world was [Malkuth], world of humans.
Demons lived on the 1th world [Keter].</p>
<p>All races fought for their dominance over other worlds.
Neither humans or demons were exception, being in state of constant war since long ago.</p>
<p>And today, demons achieved victory over humans.
With Demon King currently trying to finish this war.</p>
<p>[Choose. Will you die or will you surrender your world...
What are you going to do?]</p>
<p>[...There was no choice from the beginning, wasn't there?
Thanks to someone's betrayal, everything is already over]</p>
<p>With that Princess glared in my direction.</p>
<p>For now let's ignore this spiteful gaze.
Even I have a lot to say to her.
However, right now is not the time.
Demon King's negotiation takes priority.</p>
<p>[Oi, what's with these eyes?
Do you wish to be slaughtered?]</p>
<p>[Of course not! I-i understand.
I shall hand over human world to you]</p>
<p>And at last Princess folded.
Realizing she can do nothing about Demon King's firm attitude, she lowered her head, resigning herself.</p>
<p>On other hand, Demon King nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>[Well then, swear in the name of Sefirot: 'I shall give the Human World Malkuth to demons']</p>
<p>Demon King commanded Princess.</p>
<p>Vow under the name of Sefirot meant absolute compliance.
There was no way to break it for anyone living on Sefirot.</p>
<p>[In the name of Sefirot... I swear 'I shall give the Humand World Malkuth to demons']</p>
<p>Princess Merek obediently declared the vow.</p>
<p>With this, Human World truly became possession of demons
It was a moment when long going war between demons and humans ended.</p>
<p>With this ceremony, Human World Malkuth became property of Demon King.</p>
<p>[Now, hero. Let us fulfill our agreement]</p>
<p>Following that, Demon King gave vow in the name of Sefirot.</p>
<p>[In the name of Sefirot I declare: I shall give half of the Human World Malkuth to the Hero]</p>
<p>Right. It would seems she gave me half of the world, as she promised in Demon King castle.</p>
<p>[...Hey]</p>
<p>Hearing this vow, every one of the humans in this place were astonished.
Was my actions so unexpected I wonder...?
Well, not that it matters.</p>
<p>I betrayed humanity.
There was no point in considering their opinions.</p>
<p>[Demon King... We're done here for now.
Would you give me some time?
I have something to say to them]</p>
<p>There was something I wanted to say.
I have something I need to convey to these people who had been my companions until now.</p>
<p>[...Umu. I shall await outside.]</p>
<p>Maybe out of consideration for me, Demon King silently nodded and exited outside.
She understood my feelings.
She was indeed kind girl.</p>
<p>Hence in order to spend time with such charming girl without trouble, I had to draw line with these guys, my former companions.</p>
<p>[Well then, Princess.
There is one thing I'd like to ask]</p>
<p>[...Traitorous scum]</p>
<p>Oh, it would seem Princess revealed her true nature.
She was glaring at me as if wanting to kill me.</p>
<p>How scary.
However, weak.
For me who spent time fighting on front lines this level of killing intent was too weak.</p>
<p>[No need to glare like that.
Me and Princess are friends, aren't we?]</p>
<p>I smiled back at her and said.</p>
<p>[So, I have here half of the world, you know...
How much are you going to give for it?]</p>
<p>[Huh?]</p>
<p>[I'm saying I have half of Malkuth.
Depending on price, I'm willing to consider to sell it.]</p>
<p>At my words Princess raised her brows as if puzzled.</p>
<p>It would seem she couldn't understand my motive.</p>
<p>That's why I had to properly say it.</p>
<p>[Rather than world I want money!
I decided to retire from hero stuff, and live leisurely by Demon King's side.
For that purpose I need money...
So hey, give your money.
I'm selling here half of the world, so be thankful and buy it.]</p>
<p>World had no meaning.
From now on what I need is only money.</p>
<p>Therefore, I baited Princess with half of the world, so I could take away her money.
For me it was trash deal, but well this much is fine.</p>
<p><strong>TL Note:</strong> Makes little sense considering he could just rob her and rest of the world literally, I know, but that's how it is.</p>
<p>After all, no matter how much I worked, I was never rewarded until now.
So I wanted to get at least a bit in return.</p>
<p>[Despicable... Do you have no pride as hero!?]</p>
<p>At my demand Princess Merek raised her voice.
It would seem she is quite angry, but not like it is any concern of mine.</p>
<p>[Something happened you know.
Sorry, person I liked and made my lover changed her mind.
Afterwards there was girl I liked who turned out to be bitch, so I was quite disappointed and turned traitor.]</p>
<p>What a sad story.
Well, I'm the only one who is sad though.</p>
<p>[Why such heartlessness...
Because of you Human World is done for!
Why have you betrayed us?
Just for what kind of reason you forsaken me and your companions!]</p>
<p>There were quite shameless words.
If I'd to give reasons, they are endless.</p>
<p>However, to describe my feelings in single sentence it would be this.</p>
<p>[Because you guy didn't pamper to me!]</p>
<p>This was a focal point.</p>
<p>[Just how much I achieved you think?
How many times I had to put my life on the line you think?
And for such person you guys didn't even have a slightest of gratitude!]</p>
<p>[F-for such reason?]</p>
<p>Princess looked as if I said something unbelievable.
However for me 'such' is not the end of it.</p>
<p>[Princess, you could at least fall in love with me.
How much do you think I worked for you, the royalty?
Also, Priest, aren't you my childhood friend?
Why are you going out with Magician?
Considering how hard I worked, normally you'd have some affection for me, don't you think?]</p>
<p>Then, I turned towards the Priest.
It seems she was shocked.</p>
<p>[H-how, what do you mean going out?]</p>
<p>Did you think I knew nothing of it...?</p>
<p>At night... I could hear you panting, you know.
And you two, Warrior, Martial Artist, too.</p>
<p>To put it simply this was toughest one for me.</p>
<p>Who'd wish to hear how girl he likes was having sex with another guy,
or having to hear juniors' voice during their perverted play?
Don't copulate every night, just die.</p>
<p>[&quot;I'm sorry, I cannot go out with Hero. After all I don't like your face...&quot;
Isn't that what you said, princess?]</p>
<p>[Uhm, could you please not bring me up here?
Although I did say that]</p>
<p>[...Just why would I fall in love you, I wonder]</p>
<p>I felt a bit like crying.
Cannot even remember reason why I liked her.</p>
<p>[Hero.
I think you shouldn't do something like that just because your face is no good, you know?
It is not too late to re-consider.]</p>
<p>[Shut up, fucking Magician.
How long are you planning to pretend to be like elder brother...
Wait actually, you're supposed to be my elder brother, aren't you?
And yet, you went out with your brother's loved one.]</p>
<p><strong>TL Note:</strong> They are brothers in a sense like friends, rather than real blood brothers.</p>
<p>I wonder why this second reason?
Was I too blinded to see it as I was close enough to consider him my brother?</p>
<p>[Warrior, Martial Artist,
you're supposed to be my juniors, aren't you?
The reason you were able to go in fight so far is me, isn't it?
Yet you didn't thought to stop laughing behind my back?
Regardless how unpopular am I with ladies, it is not good to make fun of me.]</p>
<p>[...Well, senior's crude <span title="jp. アピール - as if making moves on opposite sex I suppose">appeal</span> is gross]</p>
<p>[You think it is funny to see virgin being desperate, huh?]</p>
<p>Ah, it is no good.
I cannot say anything more.
I put a lot of effort to be a good senior which was so stupid of me.</p>
<p>Deep breath.
Calm down, I'm talking about frustrations I had until now.</p>
<p>[If I'll be honest I was quite splendid hero, don't you think?.
Despite miserly reward I had no complaints,
I didn't show my complaints about low leveled companions,
I did my best not to be angry regardless of how I was treated...
And you looked down on such me, aren't you?
That's why I betrayed you.
Abandoned you.
Here we'll go on our separate ways]</p>
<p>Meanings, this is our last farewell.</p>
<p>[Hey, take out your money.
You want half of this world, aren't you?
The way things are you're going to end up as slaves to demons, you know?
So tell me how much you can give]</p>
<p>I walked towards Princess who was stirring ropes unable to free herself,
leaned towards her to ask her.
Her eyes were dark from all resentment.</p>
<p>[If it wasn't for you...]</p>
<p>[Hey, hey, you're showing your true character, you know?
Well, if you don't like idea it is fine.
I'm going to return my half of the world back to Demon King]</p>
<p>[Wait! I got...
I mean I understood you, please be so kind to sell me half of this world]</p>
<p>And just like that Princess responded with cold voice.</p>
<p>This somewhat distant and formal way of speaking made me feel like it was speaking of my separation from her and rest of humans.</p>
<p>[1,500 platinum coins... How about it?]</p>
<p>[1-1,500 you say...]</p>
<p>This offer was outrageous amount.</p>
<p>Oi, oi, with such amount you could live hundred times enjoying yourself.</p>
<p>I never used such amount of moneys so I didn't really understand it, but it was quite a sum.</p>
<p>However, since it is her initial offer, it means...
She still has some room for negotiation, doesn't she?
Just how much royal family saved?</p>
<p>Thinking about that made me irritated.</p>
<p>[Insufficient]</p>
<p>I replied with one word.</p>
<p>[However, this all our country coffers saved up, what I offer is my limit]</p>
<p>[What are you talking about?
As big shots, aren't you supposed to stash some money, too?]</p>
<p>[T-thats...]</p>
<p>Might as well take it all.
She had no way out, so I pusher her further.</p>
<p>[I want more.
2,500 platinum coins.
How is that?
If you don't like it, then let's return half of the world to the Demon King]</p>
<p>I must say I felt like I said something cruel.</p>
<p>Honestly though...
Part of wealthiest people in Humand World was so rotten that I felt it would lead to a better future if I take all of their wealth this time.</p>
<p>Meaning, it is all my kindness!
Let's roll with that.</p>
<p>[Sh... Under-stood]</p>
<p>Princess Merek feebly agreed to my demand.
From her perspective, she had no choice but to listen to my words.</p>
<p>Still, does she mean she has way to procure it?</p>
<p>[Still as expected it is 2,500 platinum coins.
Hey, quickly vow in the name of Sefirot]</p>
<p>[B-bastard... I got it, damn it!
I just have to do it, right!?
In the name of Sefirot I swear: To pay 2,500 platinum coins to the Hero in exchange for half of the Human World 'Malkuth'!]</p>
<p>[Good, very good.
In the name of Sefirot, I swear: In exchange for 2,500 platinum coins, I shall give half of the Human World 'Malkuth' to he Princess Merek]</p>
<p>With this we exchanged our vows.
Vows under the name of Sefirot were absolute.</p>
<p>Hence, bag, full of platinum coins, appeared in my hand.
These was money gathered from all over the Human World under legal coercion</p>
<p>[With this I no longer need to work]</p>
<p>I'm leaving this place with smile, satisfied by weight of platinum coins I got.
I no longer had anything to say to them.</p>
<p>[Well, work hard to live!]</p>
<p>Saying that, I turned my back to them.</p>
<p>[You fiend... You'll pay for it!]</p>
<p>Ignoring voice full of resentment behind me, I exited through the door.</p>
<p>There was Demon King, waiting for me.</p>
<p>[Did you finish your farewells?]</p>
<p>[Yeah, it is done properly]</p>
<p>[That's good... but, what is this bag?]</p>
<p>[2,500 platinum coins. I got it in exchange for my half of the world]</p>
<p>[What!? Did you just simply sell what I gave you!]</p>
<p>[Now, now, isn't it fine...
Rather let us hurry and return to Demon King Castle.
I want to drink some delicious sake]</p>
<p>[Good grief, you helpless guy.
Still, I shall forgive you]</p>
<p>Are you going to forgive me?
Seems like Demon King wants to spoil me.
Well if that's the case I thought I can depend on her and enjoy my life slowly.</p>
<p>[Kuku... Okay, I'm going to prepare tasty sake.
Tonight shall we enjoy drinks together?]</p>
<p>After that Demon King casted teleportation magic, bringing me to the Demon King Castle.</p>
<p>I parted with my past.
From now one, I'm going start new life.</p>
